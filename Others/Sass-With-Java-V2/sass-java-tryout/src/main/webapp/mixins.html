<h1>Mixins</h1>
<div class="introduction">Mixins are reusable functions that can be added to add attributes to css definitions. A mixin
    lets you make groups of CSS declarations that you want to reuse throughout your site. You can even pass in values to
    make your mixin more flexible. A good use of a mixin is for vendor prefixes. Here's an example for border-radius.
