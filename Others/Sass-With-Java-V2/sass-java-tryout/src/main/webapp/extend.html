<h1>Sass Extend</h1>

<div class="introduction">This is one of the most useful features of Sass. Using @extend lets you share a set of CSS
    properties from one selector to another. It helps keep your Sass very DRY. In our example we're going to create a
    simple series of messaging for errors, warnings and successes.
</div>

<p class="success">Thanks for your message! You will hear of us soon.</p>
<p class="error">We need your email to be able to contact you. Please enter an email address.</p>
<p class="warning">Oops... something went wrong. We will retry in five seconds</p>
