# Points to Remember
- A class contain any abstract method must be declared as abstract (otherwise IDE will give error).
- An abstract class must be declared with an abstract keyword.
- It can have abstract and non-abstract methods.
- It cannot be instantiated.
- It can have constructors and static methods also.
- It can have final methods which will force the subclass not to change the body of the method.
